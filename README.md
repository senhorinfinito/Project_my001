# Clustering - VRP

This project is a combination of Clustering & Vehicle Routine Problem. 

This project is done under the guidance of [MKP Naik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghavatu-krishna-prasanna-naik-ba000a204/). He contributed most of VRP part of project.

## Data

Our main goal is to design a cluster which is suitable for vehicle capacity as well as production capacity of individual  manufacturers. 

Based on that from where I managed to get data for clustering analysis is listed below:

1. Workers Information:  Ministry  of Textiles(Handloom)
2. Location Data : I used Google Map API to findout latitude & longitude of each Location
3. Capacity Data:  This data is collected from  transporter agencies.
4. Rating form Visitors.



### Note
All data has  not uploaded on github due to security purpose.
